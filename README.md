# QuMitra BhashaBench

Indic LLM evaluation framework by **QuMitra** – focused on Indian languages, cultural context, and real-world tasks.

## Why BhashaBench?

Most LLM benchmarks are English-first and researcher-focused. BhashaBench is:

- India-first: Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu and more.
- Developer-friendly: simple APIs and scripts.
- Open-source: built in public, for the community.

## MVP Goals

- Load standard Indic evaluation datasets.
- Run models (local / API) on prompts.
- Compute basic metrics: accuracy, relevance, fluency.
- Export results as simple reports (JSON/CSV).

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python 3.11+
- Datasets: AI4Bharat, IndicNLP, custom task sets
- Model APIs: Hugging Face, OpenAI, local models
- CLI + notebook examples first, API later

## Project Status

Restarted: November 2025  
Current phase: Designing core evaluation pipeline and data format.
